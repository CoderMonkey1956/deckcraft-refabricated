# Promise I didn't forget about this, just waiting for the mods to be updated. (Install the Alpha/Beta if you want)

# DeckCraft Reforged
A performance and ease-of-use modpack for the Steam Deck.
# ❓ But why DR?
In this modpack I included some more unknown-ish (I promise im not trying to offend anyone) mods such as [ScalableLux](https://modrinth.com/mod/scalablelux) and [Faster Random](https://modrinth.com/mod/faster-random). It also has support for many/most Optifine features.
# ⁉️ FAQ (Frequency Asked Questions)
Q: Where does the name come from?  
A: It comes from a discontinued modpack called [DeckCraft](https://modrinth.com/modpack/deckcraft) by [devin](https://modrinth.com/user/devin) in favor of [Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive) **But it is not a fork**

Q: What mods are used in this modpack?  
A: You can find a full list of mods [here](https://github.com/CoderMonkey1956/deckcraft-reforged/wiki/Mod-List)  

Q: What is the "rework"  
A: The first release was built completely from scratch, but the "rework" refers to any version after 1.21.1-1.0.0 which was made to be a heavily modified fork of [Fabulously Optimized by the Fabulously Optimized team](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized)

Q: Can I contribute to this project?  
A: I am well open to contributions! Just open a pull request or create an issue if you have any ideas/improvements. Or a typo (a lot lf this was written on a Steam Deck). 

Q: Is there any extra setup needed once I install this?  
A: In some cases, yes. [Click Here](https://github.com/CoderMonkey1956/deckcraft-reforged/wiki/Performance-Improvements) for a list of more improvements for maximum performance.  

Q: What's the update schedule?  
A: Whenever a release (no beta/alpha) comes out for FO, then it may take a day or 2 because  there is a lot that goes into making this. I will update as quickly as I can though.  

Q: What are the goals of this modpack?  
A: Theres a few, the first is to provide the best possible performance on the Steam Deck (duh), be a drop in replacement for most optifine features, optimize almost every aspect of the game, and to be open about development and be an active part of the community.  

# Additional Info
As you may have noticed, im pretty bad with Github and Modpacks in general (I had to do a lot of Googleing while making this) so any help is greatly appreciated!
