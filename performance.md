# In-Game
You will probaly want to configure Controlify to your liking (if you use the Nintendo layout in Steam settings then you need to change the inputs!!!)

# Out of the game
Because the mod uses C2ME, you will likely want to allocate extra ram to minecraft. On my Steam Deck I allocated 8G but that is probaly overkill ðŸ˜….
